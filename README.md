# Ultimate Tic Tac Toe AI

This repository contains the source code for an AI implementation of the Ultimate Tic Tac Toe game.

## Files Description

- `_MSSV.py`: Contains the main source code for the AI logic, including the Minimax algorithm and the evaluation function for the game state.

- `test_game.py`: Used to test the game. Run this file to see the AI in action and to play the game.

## Running the Game

To test the game, run the `test_game.py` script. This will start the game where you can see the AI's decisions in real-time.

## AI Implementation

The AI uses the Minimax algorithm to determine the best moves. The `evaluate` function in `_MSSV.py` assesses the game state to guide the AI's decisions.
